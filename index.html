        <p id="introduction" class="lead-in">Learning how to code is not an easy path, some days you will feel
          confused, in those days you should always remember your goal and why have you started to program in the
          first place.
        </p>

        <p class="text">I should start by telling you that six months ago, <strong>I had
            no idea</strong> about who <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Tim
            Berners Lee</a>
          was neither what <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>
          was about it.</p>

        <p class="text">It's been a wonderful process of learning and improvement daily,
          as a person, as a student and also as a
          future programmer.</p>
        <p class="text">That is why, I can tell you some stages I've been and actually,
          I am going through since I started to coding.</p>

        <h2 id="phases-title">The Web programming learning process.</h2>

        <ul class="phases">

          <li>
            <h3>A new world:</h3>
            If you are like me and you had zero experience with programming before,
            soon you see that <strong>programming is everywhere</strong>, no matter
            what you do for a living, there is very high chances you do what you do
            thanks to the code someone else wrote.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Learning how to learn:</h3>
            Do you remember in class, at High-school when a quick reading and ten minutes
            of memory before a test was all that you needed to pass the test? well, in
            programming that does not work,<strong> it is important to take notes and
              check your info to remember rules in the future.</strong>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Be organized:</h3>
            In the last point is said that taking notes is important and in my personal
            experience I can tell you it is also worth it. It does not matter if you
            have ten years of experience, <strong>you will always check your notes</strong>,
            it is totally normal to forget some code, especially because you won't use all
            that you know in all your projects.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Constantly improvement:</h3>
            <strong>Be ready for never stop learning,</strong> this career has no limits,
            you always have something new to learn and the things you knew three years ago, are
            slightly different now.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text">Each one of us will have different approaches and problems at the
          time to learn, basically because we will take different curses, teachers and
          information sources.</p>

        <p class="text">You should make sure that no matter what path you take, you do
          with passion and looking for the satisfaction of being happy doing what you love.</p>

        <p class="text">The idea of having fun and being happy doing what you love remember me what Linus Torvalds said
          once...</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p class="quote">
            Most good programmers do programming <br>
            not because they expect to get paid or <br>
            get adulation by the public, but because <br>
            it is fun to program. <br>
          </p>
          <p class="author-cited"> &mdash; <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank">Linus
              Torvalds</a></p>
          <p class="cited">Finnish computer scientist who was the principal force
            behind the development of the Linux operating system</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="text">Finally, keep in mind that becoming a great programmer is a really slow process.
        </p>

        <p class="text">The key is to have commitment, fun and consistency.</p>
